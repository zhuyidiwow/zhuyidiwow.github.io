                <hr class="star-primary">
                <h3>What's this?</h3>
                <p>Rule set for the game <i>Pirates of the Whirl</i>, which is created for the Game Design class.</p>
                <p>
                    This is only the rule set, if you want to play the game, <a href="mailto:zhuyidiwow@gmail.com">contact me!</a>
                </p>

                <h3>Set up</h3>

                <p>
                    Place the map on a table. Each player gets to pick a ship, name the ship, and write the name on it. Each player gets an account book, that matches the ship’s color. Each player gets 2,000 golds as starting fund.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, each player choose a starting port. (The map is symmetric so it doesn’t really matter! Choose anyone you want!)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each player rolls two dices, whoever largest gets to move first.
                </p>

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Whoever gets 20,000 golds first wins!</p>

                <h3>Flow</h3>
                <p>Player take turns to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Roll two dices. The movement is the difference between two dices. However, if the two dice are identical, like two 5s, the movement point will be 5 instead of 0.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The player can move as he/she wants.
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    During/before/after movement, player can trade with ports. Player can only trade with ports when sitting inside them.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            Trading prices are written on the “price list” sheet that’s included in the package.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    During/before/after movement, if a player (A) gets adjacent to another player (B)’s ship, or onto another player (B)’s ship, player A can choose to attack player B. See the “Battle mechanics” sheet for more information.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Note: each player can only attack once in her/his turn. And attacking doesn’t cost movement points.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>

                                </li>
                            </ol>
                                </li>
                    <li>Then the turn ends. The player draws a card. Move on to the next player’s turn.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p> Notes:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The player can use as many action cards during his/her turn as he/she wants.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a ship is in the whirld, or in a port, other ships cannot attack it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For rules on map areas and cards, see attached sheets in the package.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p><b>One more thing: Remember to draw a card at the end of your turn.</b></p>
