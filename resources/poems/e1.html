    <p>Bountiful Givers,</p>

    <p>I look along the years</p>

    <p>And see the flowers you threw…</p>

    <p>Anemones</p>

    <p>And sprigs of gray</p>

    <p>Sparse heather of the rocks,</p>

    <p>Or a wild violet</p>

    <p>Or daisy of a daisied field…</p>

    <p>But each your best.</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>I might have worn them on my breast</p>

    <p>To wilt in the long day…</p>

    <p>I might have stemmed them in a narrow vase</p>

    <p>And watched each petal sallowing…</p>

    <p>I might have held them so—mechanically—</p>

    <p>Till the wind winnowed all the leaves</p>

    <p>And left upon my hands</p>

    <p>A little smear of dust.</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>Instead</p>

    <p>I hid them in the soft warm loam</p>

    <p>Of a dim shadowed place…</p>

    <p>Deep</p>

    <p>In a still cool grotto,</p>

    <p>Lit only by the memories of stars</p>

    <p>And the wide and luminous eyes</p>

    <p>Of dead poets</p>

    <p>That love me and that I love…</p>

    <p>Deep…deep…</p>

    <p>Where none may see—not even ye who gave—</p>

    <p>About my soul your garden beautiful.</p>
