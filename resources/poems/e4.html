    <h4 class="margin30 englishH4">Author: Lizette Woodworth Reese</h4>

    <p>No wind, no bird. The river flames like brass.</p>

    <p>On either side, smitten as with a spell</p>

    <p>Of silence, brood the fields. In the deep grass,</p>

    <p>Edging the dusty roads, lie as they fell</p>

    <p>Handfuls of shriveled leaves from tree and bush.</p>

    <p>But ’long the orchard fence and at the gate,</p>

    <p>Thrusting their saffron torches through the hush,</p>

    <p>Wild lilies blaze, and bees hum soon and late.</p>

    <p>Rust-colored the tall straggling briar, not one</p>

    <p>Rose left. The spider sets its loom up there</p>

    <p>Close to the roots, and spins out in the sun</p>

    <p>A silken web from twig to twig. The air</p>

    <p>Is full of hot rank scents. Upon the hill</p>

    <p>Drifts the noon’s single cloud, white, glaring, still.</p>
