    <p>Whether or not the water was freezing. The body</p>

    <p>would break its sheathe. Without layer on layer</p>

    <p>of feather and air to insulate the loving belly.</p>

    <p>A cloudy film surrounding the point of entry. If blue</p>

    <p>were not blue how could love be love. But if the body</p>

    <p>were made of rings. A loose halo would emerge</p>

    <p>in the telluric light. If anyone were entrusted to verify</p>

    <p>this rare occurrence. As the petal starts to</p>

    <p>dwindle and curl unto itself. And only then. Love,</p>

    <p>blue. Hallucinogenic blue, love.</p>
