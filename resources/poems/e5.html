    <p>It’s true there were times when it was too much</p>

    <p>and I slipped off in the first light or its last hour</p>

    <p>and drove up through the crooked way of the valley</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>and swam out to those ruins on an island.</p>

    <p>Blackbirds were the only music in the spruces,</p>

    <p>and the stars, as they faded out, offered themselves to me</p>

    <p>like glasses of water ringing by the empty linens of the dead.</p>

    <p>When Delilah watched the dark hair of her lover</p>

    <p>tumble, she did not shatter. When Abraham</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>relented, he did not relent.</p>

    <p>Still, I would tell you of the humbling and the waking.</p>

    <p>I would tell you of the wild hours of surrender,</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>when the river stripped the cove’s stones</p>

    <p>from the margin and the blackbirds built</p>

    <p>their strict songs in the high</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>pines, when the great nests swayed the lattice</p>

    <p>of the branches, the moon’s brute music</p>

    <p>touching them with fire.</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>And you, there, stranger in the sway</p>

    <p>of it, what would you have done</p>

    <p>there, in the ruins, when they rose</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>from you, when the burning wings</p>

    <p>ascended, when the old ghosts</p>

    <p>shook the music from your branches and the great lie</p>

    <p><br></p>

    <p>of your one sweet life was lifted?</p>
