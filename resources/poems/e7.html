    <h3 class="margin30 englishH3">What can I hold you with?</h3>

    <h4 class="margin30 englishH4">Author: Jorge Luis Borges</h4>

	<p>I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the moon of the jagged suburbs. </p>

	<p>I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at the lonely moon.</p>

	<p>I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts that living men have honoured in marble: </p>

	<p>my father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs, bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in the hide of a cow; my mother's grandfather -just twentyfour- heading a charge of three hundred men in Per√∫, now ghosts on vanished horses.</p>

	<p><br></p>
	<p>I offer you whatever insight my books may hold. whatever manliness or humour my life. </p>

	<p>I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal. </p>

	<p>I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved somehow -the central heart that deals not in words, traffics not with dreams and is untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.</p>

	<p>I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset, years before you were born. </p>

	<p>I offer you explanationsof yourself, theories about yourself, authentic and surprising news of yourself. </p>

	<p>I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.</p>
