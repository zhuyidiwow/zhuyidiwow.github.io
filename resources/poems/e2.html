    <p>Slowly the moon is rising out of the ruddy haze,</p>

    <p>Divesting herself of her golden shift, and so</p>

    <p>Emerging white and exquisite; and I in amaze</p>

    <p>See in the sky before me, a woman I did not know</p>

    <p>I loved, but there she goes and her beauty hurts my heart;</p>

    <p>I follow her down the night, begging her not to depart.</p>
