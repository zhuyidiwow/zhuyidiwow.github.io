        <h3>What are we talking about?</h3>

<p>I had a talk with Jesse. I was planning to pitch a project where the team can quickly &amp; individually make prototypes to prove something, much like the idea behind the <em>Experimental Gameplay</em> project. It turned out, there’s been abundant research effort put into this space and there is not much left to be done, but there is still one thing: find out what makes a game art, through rapid prototyping or any technique that could work. This topic interested me a lot - I’ve been talking about art games, but I’ve never thought about the term <em>art games</em> itself deeply. I’m trying to write this blog as the preliminary study for this research topic. </p>

<p>First, let’s make the question clear. I hope I no longer need to argue about whether games are an art form in 2018. If you don’t agree with me on this, I’m sorry that you need to pretend you do to continue reading. The question I’m trying to answer is, just like not all movies are art, not all games are art, then, what separate artistic games from non-artistic games? Let’s start by looking at the term <em>“art”</em>.</p>

<h3>What is art in general?</h3>

<p><em>Kellee Santiag</em>o quoted Wikipedia to define art in her TED talk: “Art is the process or product of deliberately arranging elements in a way that appeals to the sense or emotions”. I believe it’s a valid definition. It’s inclusive enough to explain why <em>Marcel Duchamp</em>’s <em>Fountain </em>is art. So art games are the games that appeal to the sense or emotions! Great! Question answered! </p>

<p>Not really, I would like to extend on the definition and propose a more concrete methodology for examining art games. Are there visible and tangible elements that frequently appear in art games, and thus can be used as parameters to tell if a game is a work of art? Let’s start by looking at a simple one: </p>

<h3>Does incorporating other art forms make a game art?</h3>

<p>Games definitely has visual and aural parts in it, and they are usually art by themselves. But do they make a game art? Sort of, but not really. It’s not hard to argue that other art forms incorporated in a game can appeal to senses and emotions, and thus making the game itself art. There are plenty of examples, like <em>Ori and the Blind Forest, </em>who<em> </em>has oil-painting style graphics, or <em>Manifold Garden</em>, which is a poem of structures. However, if we agree on this, how do we argue that games can be an art form by itself? Look at other art forms like music, paintings, drama, etc. Each of them <em>is</em> art <em>by itself</em>. The point is, an art form should not rely on other art forms.</p>

<p>On the other hand, although I disagree that incorporated other art forms are what makes a game art, I do agree that they can create <em>an artistic feel </em>in the players’ experience. The game <em>Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</em> can be a good example. In this game, player plays as a spectator, who wanders around an abandoned village to reveal its mystery. The visual arts, music, and drama in this game are all excellent. They make the game feel artistic, and make the process of revealing the story enjoyable. But it hardly feels like a game for me. One can simply put all the cutscenes together to make a movie, and I bet it still works! The reason is that this game relies heavily on other art forms, and vastly loses its own meaning. Even the interactions doesn’t carry meanings in themselves, they are just the tools to trigger more cutscenes. So this brings me to another point: meaningful interactions make a game art.</p>

<h4>Aside</h4>

<p>A lesson here is that that we can use other art forms to enhance the artist feel of our games. <em>Flower </em>has meaningful interactions which empower the player to permanently change a world, and the developer team supplemented them with great visuals and music to enhance the artistic feel. And the game was later exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art of New York.</p>

<h3>Meaningful interactions</h3>

<p>This seems like a promising point. There is one extreme argument: “good games are still enjoyable even after removing all graphics and music technologies” - that’s to say, a game’s heart is its mechanics, it’s all about how you interact with them. But arguments as extreme as this one are hardly true. What I would like to argue is: a game with meaningful interactions that can provoke thinking can be viewed as art. Usually, the result of this thinking process can be applied to the real world outside the game itself. </p>

<p>Let’s test it. <em>Journey,</em> <em>Civilizations, WoW, Papers Please</em> and a lot of other games with thought-provoking interactions can be viewed as games. But this rules out games that can hardly be related to the real life - like platformers. In those games, what you learn in the game stays in the game, so even when the game invites you to think, the result of your thinking can only be applied in the game.</p>

<p>However, people do think platformers are art. So this argument is still one-sided if not wrong. Let’s try another one: a game is art if its creator tries to touch the audience.</p>

<h3>Creator’s vision</h3>

<p>“..moved by a desire to touch audience.” Even game designers as arrogant as jonathan blow, have the motivation to touch the audience. He makes games, so that the players can get a new view on the whole world. Can we go back to the past and behave differently and pretend nothing has happened? Does learning from mistakes really help?</p>

<!--
<p>There is reverence in game design. <strong>This is why most commercial games are not art!</strong> <strong>There can be a discussion on business and art.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I suddenly realize that, I’m not really sure what I’m talking about.</strong></p>

<p>I confess that I’m still afraid of talking about art. There is something in art games that make me tremble and revere. This is partly why this blog post is more like a collection of scattering thoughts than a structured argument.</p>

<p>But we need to set the heavy reverence aside before I can move forward. I hope these arguments can direct art game creators to find the right way. But, can art be directed? If yes, is directed art still art?</p>

<p>Ok… after this preliminary study, I come to the conclusion that a pitch project may not be able to answer this, but it’s still worth trying.</p>
