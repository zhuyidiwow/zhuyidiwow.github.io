        <h2>Hero’s Journey in Almost Famous</h2>
        <hr class="star-primary">
        <h3>1 Introduction</h3>

        <p>This essay analyses how the movie Almost Famous (2000) reflects Joseph Campbell&#39;s theory of Hero’s Journey. The analysis covers both how each step of hero’s journey is reflected and how the characters represent archetypes. This essay is based vastly on the interpretations in Christopher Vogler’s The Writer’s Journey (2007) instead of the original work of Campbell.</p>

        <p>This movie reflects hero’s journey from different aspects and each character in the movie goes through their own hero’s journey in some form, but the essay puts its emphasis on William Miller and mainly sees through his eyes and discusses his hero’s journey. The discussion on character archetypes is mixed with the discussion on story steps.</p>

        <h3>2 Departure</h3>

        <h4>2.1 The ordinary world</h4>

        <p>The movie starts with the <strong>hero </strong>William’s <strong>ordinary world</strong>, where he lived under his strict mom, Elaine, who is an English professor in college. Apart from being strict, Elaine also has a high expectation on William, so William skipped grades, became the youngest kid in class and got bullied in school. </p>

        <h4>2.2 The call to adventure</h4>

        <p>William received several <strong>calls to adventure</strong> from different sources. The first one is the box of rock ‘n’ roll CDs his sister gave him when she left home. The second one is his experience of interviewing Black Sabbath, where he met Stillwater and received the invitation to move to Morocco from Penny Lane. The third one is Ben’s invitation for him to write a story for Rolling Stone magazine.</p>

        <p>However, there is a major call on top of them, which is William’s inherent desire for getting involved with rock ‘n’ roll and becomes a rock journalist. This desire drives him to write for school publications, reaches out to Lester for help, starts writing for Creem magazine and is why he can finally get the opportunity of writing for Rolling Stone. </p>

        <p>In the stages, all calls to adventure are <strong>heralds</strong>, among which the call from Ben is the major one. </p>

        <h4>2.3 Refusal of the call</h4>

        <p>William didn’t completely refuse the calls nor accept them. Instead, he followed the call and progressed slowly on his way of being a rock journalist without leaving his ordinary world. But when he received the call from Ben and accepted Ben’s quest, he still felt anxiety and uncertainty and called Lester for help.</p>

        <p>In this stage, the refusal mainly comes from Elaine, who is his <strong>threshold guardian</strong>.</p>

        <h4>2.4 Meeting with the mentor</h4>

        <p>The movie does not follow the steps in hero’s journey, and William met his mentor while receiving calls to adventure. William reached out to Lester and Lester was kind enough to be his <strong>mentor</strong>, and became the single man who William would turn to every time he encounters problems. </p>

        <p>William and Lester are similar with each other in some ways: they both have a genuine love for rock ‘n’ roll, they both write for rock ‘n’ roll, and they are both uncool. But Lester is experienced enough to provide William with advice and guidance along the journey.</p>

        <h4>2.5 Crossing the threshold</h4>

        <p>Although feeling uncomfortable, William was still willing to enter the special world because of his inherent desire. So Elaine is the <strong>threshold </strong>he needs to cross. William talked to Elaine in a peaceful way and got the permission.</p>

        <p>However, Elaine is more than just a <strong>threshold guardian </strong>because she had a continuous influence on William even after he entered the special world. There is a representative line from Elaine that is being constantly reused and reinforced in the movie: “Don’t take drugs!” The author thinks this line is a metaphor, which shows how much Elaine cares about William and how she tries to drag Willam back to the <strong>ordinary world</strong> every time it is used.</p>

        <h3>3 Initiation</h3>

        <h4>3.1 Tests, allies and enemies</h4>

        <p>William had already met some of his allies and enemies before getting on Stillwater’s bus, such as Russell as an enemy and Penny as an ally. But as he continued into the special world, he found new <strong>allies </strong>and <strong>enemies </strong>which are not necessarily human: his love for Penny became a major <strong>enemy</strong>, and the role of a rock journalist became his <strong>ally </strong>by giving him a goal to pursue without completely losing himself. Although his love for Penny is described as an <strong>enemy </strong>here, it still drives William’s behaviors in a good way in most cases and leads to positive psychological changes later on. He also built up friendships with band members along the way, which later became <strong>shapeshifters </strong>for him. The friendship affected his way of dealing with his affection for Penny and made him hesitated on what to put in the story.</p>

        <p>William then went through <strong>tests </strong>together with them. The accident where Russell got the electric shock on stage was the last time when the band is still a team. After this accidents, things started to change, and conflicts start to reveal. Jeff is the <strong>trickster </strong>in this stage, he broke the steady state and made everyone reflect on their lives and the band.</p>

        <p>During these tests, William also learned the rules of this special rock ‘n’ roll world: what people love and hate, how people build relationships and how people express. </p>

        <h4>3.2 Approach</h4>

        <p>William <strong>approached </strong>forward by building up his relationship with the band and collecting materials for his story. But along the way, the band ran into a series of serious conflicts. The conflicts are William’s <strong>allies </strong>as they help him see things, which leads to his change.</p>

        <p>William started to find out who they truly are and look at them more clearly. Although everyone was always talking about music, William found out it is not music what they love and care about. For Jeff, it’s fame and respect. For Russell, it’s being the leader, keeping the band together, and getting admired and pursued by girls. For Penny, it’s being together with Russell and getting Russell’s love and care. For Dennis, it’s business success.</p>

        <p>It became clear to William that they were all using music as a “tool” for their goals. He hesitated to accept the fact and write it up in his story. He also hesitated to tell Penny the truth but he finally did when they were talking in the forest, which prepared them for <strong>the ordeal</strong>.</p>

        <p>The call from Rolling Stone saying the deadline is only four days away starts a <strong>ticking clock</strong> and foreshadows that William will start his <strong>road back</strong> soon.</p>

        <h4>3.3 The ordeal</h4>

        <p>William faced the ordeal when Penny abused drugs and almost killed herself. Before this ordeal, he could always hide from himself, but here he was forced to confront his enemy - his love for Penny - and came to a resolution. He faced his innermost feelings, expressed his love in an abnormal way and finally saved Penny’s life.</p>

        <p>The ordeal changes William in three ways: he learned how to face his love; he began to know how to treat the band; and he began to think about the difference in the band’s words and behaviors. These are the skills and tools he got to change the ordinary world when he went back to it.</p>

        <h4>3.4 The reward</h4>

        <p>The rewards come in two forms: he learned Penny’s real name; and he realized he couldn&#39;t be Penny’s life partner, which eliminates one of his <strong>enemies </strong>- love for Penny. The scripts he got can also be seen as a reward but the author thinks <strong>psychological rewards</strong> have a bigger impact on him and thus are more important.</p>

        <h3>4 Return</h3>

        <h4>4.1 The road back</h4>

        <p>In the author’s point of view, William’s psychological <strong>road back</strong> started when Penny left New York. He had seen enough of the rock world and became disappointed by its culture and people. What’s more important, he had got enough materials for his story, so he is psychologically and physically ready to go back to his <strong>ordinary world.</strong> </p>

        <p>On the other hand, the call from Rolling Stone speeded up the<strong> ticking clock</strong> of the road back, so there is an urgent, extrinsic reason that force William to go back.</p>

        <h4>4.2 The resurrection</h4>

        <p>The electrical storm William and the band encountered on the airplane leads to their resurrection. In front of death, everyone was forced to face their inner fear, confront their worst <strong>enemies</strong>, and confess. Although everything turned out to be fine after several minutes, everyone got a rebirth after it. </p>

        <p>For William, apart from being able to face himself, he could speak it out loud to everyone, which in turn reinforces what he got from the <strong>ordeal</strong>. More importantly, what others said during the storm gave him a clearer vision to look at the rock culture. For Russell, he confronted his <strong>shadow</strong>: he accepted the conflicts inside the band and started to take care of it seriously. He also confronted his love for Penny. </p>

        <p>It’s also a <strong>resurrection </strong>for William when his manuscripts got rejected by Rolling Stone after fact check. But it’s not as strong, and William did not proactively take actions. In this event, Russell wore the mask of a <strong>hero </strong>because he called Rolling Stone and told them the truth. </p>

        <h4>4.3 Return with the elixir</h4>

        <p>William changed the ordinary world in different ways after getting back. First, he took his sister back home after coming across her. Second, the band abandoned all those business plans and put their love for music as the most important thing for the value. This change is vastly driven by Russell, whose philosophy of treating people and music was changed by William. Third, Penny rejected Russell’s request to meet and moved to Morocco. Finally, after this journey, William had found his better self and was leading his life in a better way. The movie didn’t show how William’s article affect the world of rock ‘n’ roll, but it’s reasonable to predict that the article will shift the industry in a positive way.</p>
