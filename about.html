                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <hr class="star-primary">
                <p>
                    My name is Yidi (pronounced like <i>Edie</i>). I am a passionate <i>game designer and programmer</i>. I'm currently pursuing my <b>Master of Entertainment Technology</b> degree at the <i>Entertainment Technology Center</i> of <i>Carnegie Mellon University</i>, and expect to graduate in May 2019.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm also remotely leading a small indie game company based in Hong Kong. We dedicate ourselves to crafting intrinsically fun games.
                </p>

                <h3>What do I do?</h3>
                <hr class="star-primary">
                <p>
                    I make games. Sometimes also other interactive experiences. It's my dream to spend my life making games, and, I'm living my dream.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beside games, I play the guitar, make handcrafts, swim, play badminton, and travel.
                </p>

                <h3>What's my design philosophy?</h3>

                <hr class="star-primary">

                <p class="small-btm-margin"><b>1. Games are art.</b></p>
                <p>
                    I'm an advocate for <b>"Games are art"</b>. Part of it is because games can be visually and aurally stunning, but more importantly, the interactivity in games makes them stand out from other art forms. <b>Mechanics</b> are the most powerful way to invoke emotions and inspire people.
                </p>

                <p class="small-btm-margin"><b>2. Designs serve goals.</b></p>
                <p>
                    Each game should has its major goals it wants to achieve and each single design decision should be made to better serve the goals. It's a good way to prevent designs from going too far.
                </p>

                <p class="small-btm-margin"><b>3. Feedbacks. And more feedbacks.</b></p>
                <p>
                    Strong and rich feedbacks are the key to immersive experiences. I try to give as rich feedbacks as possible for each interaction. They can be visual, aural, or even tactile when possible. Interactions without rich feedback should not exist in games <i>(unless they are conscious decisions that serve certain design goals)</i>.
                </p>

                <p class="small-btm-margin"><b>4. Iterations are the key.</b></p>
                <p>
                    Each game should start small as a prototype and grow through iterations. There is more than once when I started from a small prototype, playtest it, iterate on it, and finally build something really cool. And there is more than once when playtesters saved my design.
                </p>
